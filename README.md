# markdown-blog-templates
A fork of https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-blog/ for building a blog site with markdown files and a single index.html.

I've split the original repository into two different repositories:
  * one for the example markdown. [(that one)](https://github.com/clholm/markdown-blog-templates)
  * one with the JavaScript, CSS, and `index.html` files that provide the markdown blog functionality. I intend to import this repository as a submodule when I need it. (this one)
